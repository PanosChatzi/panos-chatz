I have a PhD in exercise physiology from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. In my PhD, I investigated the role of the erythrocyte glycolytic and redox metabolism in muscle oxygenation and exercise performance, by combining experimental and computational approaches. I am also interested in R and Python for statistical programming, data analysis and visualization.
