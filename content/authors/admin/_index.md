I am a PhD candidate in exercise physiology at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. My research interests include redox biology, erythrocyte metabolism, oxygen transport, exercise performance and fatigue. I am also passionate about R programming, data visualization and science communication.

In my PhD, I am investigating the effects of exercise-induced oxidative stress on erythrocyte glycolysis and redox metabolism, and the effect on muscle oxygenation and exercise performance. My higher aim is to implement systems biology and computational methods in the fields of exercise physiology and biochemistry.
