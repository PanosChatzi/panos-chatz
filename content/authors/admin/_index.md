I am a PhD candidate in exercise physiology at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. My research interests include redox biology, erythrocyte metabolism, oxygen transport, exercise performance and fatigue. I am also passionate about R programming and science communication.

In my project, I am studying the effects of exercise-induced oxidative stress on oxygen transport, muscle oxygenation and fatigue. My higher aim is to implement systems biology and computational methods in the fields of exercise physiology and biochemistry.
